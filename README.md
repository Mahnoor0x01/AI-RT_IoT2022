# RT-IOT2022 
This project utilizes the RT_IoT2022 dataset, which contains IoT network traffic data with labeled attack 
types, to build a machine learning model for anomaly detection. The report covers data preprocessing, 
feature selection, model building using clustering in **K-Means** and Classification in **Na√Øve Bayes(GaussianNB)**, and performance evaluation
